It’s computer-generated, of course, but it sounds like two human hosts performing a podcast solely for your benefit—with a focus on the areas you asked for and as much personalization as you’ve opted to include.Huxe serves up a single, personalized news brief every morning—but that’s not all.🗣️ Now, here’s where it gets really surreal: While your podcast is playing, you can tap a microphone icon and interrupt it—to ask questions about something, ask for clarifications or more info about a story, or ask anything else that comes to your mind as you’re listening.Whenever you speak, the “hosts” stop speaking and listen; then, within a matter of seconds, they respond to your request as if they are actually chatting with you. After they’re done addressing your inquiry, they segue naturally back into the rest of your predetermined program.Here, for instance, I interrupted a segment about some incoming Google Play Store changes to ask whether the new features would be available globally or only in the U.S., for now—which hadn’t initially been mentioned in my podcast. (I turned on live captioning to capture the app’s spoken response.)Your Huxe podcasts will stop and listen whenever you ask a question, then respond before continuing on with the program.☝️ In addition to the standard morning briefings, you can open up Huxe anytime to get an on-the-spot custom podcast update, and you can tune in to a variety of “live stations” with varying themes related to your interests. You can even create your own custom live stations or “DeepCasts” to get instant podcasts on practically any topic imaginable, anytime.The app gives you a sprawling selection of custom and on-demand podcast options.And all of that is still just scratching the surface.Now, two unavoidable reality checks:First, could the systems involved here get facts wrong—as AI systems so frequently do?It’s certainly possible and arguably even likely. AI has thus far proven itself to be extremely fallible and untrustworthy, and that’s in large part just par for the course with the way the underlying technology works.In my relatively limited experience with Huxe so far, I’ve yet to run into any obvious examples of errant information. But that doesn’t mean it won’t happen. And it’s something I’d strongly suggest anyone using an app like this keep a close eye on and keep top of mind.Second, is it slightly unsettling how good this is and how human it seems?Yup—sure is. But is it insanely impressive at the same time and something I could absolutely see being appreciated by an awful lot of people? You’d better believe it.Whether you end up using the app often or just playing around with it for a while, it’s one seriously cool and impossibly interesting tool that’s well worth your while to investigate.And hey, who knows? You might just end up loving it.Huxe is available for both Android​ and ​iOS​. There isn’t a web version (yet), but it’ll work on essentially any phone in front of you.It’s free to use for the moment, without any asterisks, and I’ve yet to encounter any kind of advertising. I’ve gotta think there’ll eventually be ads integrated into the shows and/or premium subscriptions of some sort offered, but the company hasn’t spoken to any such specifics so far.The app does require you to sign in—with either a Google account or an email address—but no other form of personal info is required. Huxe’s privacy policy​ says the service may use your voice data for improving its system but never uses any personal calendar or email info for training without an explicit opt-in.Treat yourself to all sorts of brain-boosting goodies like this with the free Cool Tools newsletter—starting with an instant introduction to an incredible audio app that’ll tune up your days in truly delightful ways.",

      'Skeptics on Wall Street think the rise of ChatGPT could pose an existential threat to Google Search.The post Did Alphabet just say "Checkmate" to OpenAI? appeared first on The Motley Fool Australia.',
    content:
      "This article was originally published on Fool.com. All figures quoted in US dollars unless otherwise stated.Key PointsThe popularity of ChatGPT and similar models has analysts questioning Alphabet's dominance in online search.But based on Alphabet's financial profile, ad revenue from Google appears to be keeping pace in the AI era.Alphabet has reinvested these profits into other moneymaking opportunities that remain overlooked.Ever since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT to the public a few years ago, some Wall Street analysts have sounded the alarm for Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG). The concern is straightforward: As consumers increasingly turn to chatbots to answer queries, Alphabet's long-standing dominance in Google Search could face disruption.Since the bulk of the company's revenue comes from advertising fees tied to search, any erosion in Google's market share seemingly poses an existential threat to Alphabet's financial engine. On the surface, this bearish narrative is compelling. But the reality is far more nuanced.Alphabet's financial resilience, strategic partnerships, and product evolution suggests that the company is not only prepared to defend its turf but may also emerge stronger in the face of rising competition.Analyzing Alphabet's financial fortressIn the table below, I've summarized Alphabet's advertising revenue from Google Search over the past year:CategoryQ3 2024Q4 2024Q1 2025Q2 2025Google Search revenue (in billions)$49.4$54.0$50.7$54.2Growth (YOY)12%12%10%12%Data source: Alphabet. YOY = year over year.Given the profile above, there is little evidence that ChatGPT or other large language models (LLMs) represent material headwinds for Google's dominance across the internet. The figures above suggest that advertisers continue to view Google as one of the most effective channels for capturing engagement and attention online.What's even more critical to recognize is that Alphabet's advertising business operates at exceptionally high profit margins. This profitability provides the company with a powerful buffer. What I mean by that is if LLMs eventually chip away at Google's market share, Alphabet is still well-positioned to absorb the impact by reinvesting this cash flow into next-generation products -- a strategy the company is already executing today.In recent years, Alphabet has poured significant resources into expanding its cloud infrastructure platform to better compete with Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS). At the heart of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) is its custom-built hardware, Tensor Processing Units (TPUs). These are specialized chips designed to handle advanced artificial intelligence (AI) workloads such as machine learning and deep learning.In a striking development, OpenAI signed on as a major GCP client. The irony here is hard to dismiss: Even if ChatGPT diverts some internet traffic that might otherwise flow to Google, Alphabet still benefits financially on the back end by powering the very company allegedly threatening its leadership position.Â Turning Google into an LLMAlphabet's defensive posture extends well beyond monetization. The company has also integrated its own AI model, Gemini, across its ecosystem.Within Google Search, users can now toggle into \"AI Mode\" -- effectively transforming the search experience into an LLM-powered interface. By embedding a ChatGPT-like experience natively into Google, the company layers its own generative AI capabilities into the familiar query box.This approach delivers two major advantages. First, it preserves ingrained user habits -- making switching to other platforms less appealing. Second, it allows Alphabet to maintain robust advertising economics -- albeit in a reimagined format.Together, these moves underscore a dual positioning: defending the core search business while simultaneously profiting from the very companies seeking disruption. Put differently, Alphabet isn't treating LLMs as a binary threat. Instead, the company has created a hedge that few can match -- making money whether users type a query into Google or send a prompt to ChatGPT.Is now a good time to buy Alphabet stock?While OpenAI currently commands much of the cultural and technological AI spotlight, Alphabet's response is more than simple defensive insulation. The company is actively reshaping its narrative -- repositioning itself as a business woven together by AI-powered services.GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) data by YChartsThe valuation expansion outlined above suggests that investors are now just beginning to recognize the breadth of Alphabet's AI story. Yet, based on forward earnings, the market has not assigned the same premium to Alphabet as other beneficiaries of the AI revolution.Alphabet may not have declared a \"checkmate\" against OpenAI, but it has clearly moved past a stalemate. With its shares trading at a steep discount to its peers, I see Alphabet stock as a compelling opportunity as the company's AI investments continue to bear fruit.Â This article was originally published on Fool.com.

      "September 25, Colombo (LNW): In a powerful address to the 80th United Nations General Assembly in New York, Sri Lankan President Anura Kumara Dissanayake made an impassioned plea for international unity in the face of escalating global challenges. Speaking during the morning session on the 25th (Sri Lanka time), the President called on global leaders to embrace a shared responsibility for creating a secure and humane world for generations yet to come.President Dissanayake began by drawing urgent attention to the deepening humanitarian disaster in the Gaza Strip, condemning the ongoing violence and loss of innocent lives. He issued a stern appeal for an immediate cessation of hostilities, the unobstructed flow of humanitarian assistance, and the release of all hostages in accordance with resolutions brokered by the United Nations and other international actors. Stressing the severity of the crisis, he called on the international community to apply meaningful pressure to stop the bloodshed and to act with resolve and compassion.Beyond the crisis in Gaza, the President addressed a broader spectrum of global issues, describing poverty as an enduring blight that continues to breed inequality and instability across nations. He urged world leaders to treat poverty not as an isolated domestic issue, but as a systemic global emergency that demands coordinated and decisive action. In his view, economic disparity and social marginalisation represent moral failures that fuel conflict, disillusionment and extremism.Turning to the issue of narcotics, President Dissanayake warned of the far-reaching consequences of the global drug trade, describing it as a corrosive force that jeopardises public health, undermines democratic institutions and threatens societal cohesion. He pointed to Sri Lanka’s own multi-pronged approach to combating drug abuse—focusing on stricter border control, legal reform, and expanded rehabilitation infrastructure—as a potential model for international cooperation. He called for a collective global initiative that tackles drug trafficking at its roots and prioritises the rehabilitation of those afflicted by addiction.On the topic of corruption, the President characterised it as a pernicious enemy of development, equity and democracy. He stressed that corruption entrenches poverty and thwarts progress, highlighting Sri Lanka’s commitment to building a transparent and ethical governance framework. Acknowledging the difficulty of this task, he nonetheless declared it an essential battle in the effort to create just and prosperous societies. He encouraged nations to embed a culture of integrity within public institutions and to foster civic trust through transparency and accountability.In his closing remarks, President Dissanayake spoke of the Sri Lankan people’s determination to build a brighter future founded on dignity and justice. He reaffirmed the country’s commitment to a vision of national renewal under the banner of “A Thriving Nation – A Beautiful Life,” a concept rooted in ethical governance, digital innovation, environmental responsibility, and equitable access to education and healthcare. The President noted that these goals are being pursued with determination and unity, aiming to transform Sri Lanka into a model of sustainable, inclusive progress.Full Speech:Madam President, Mr. General Secretary, honoured invitees and distinguished delegates, Allow me, Madame Annalena Baerbock, representing the beautiful country of Germany, to begin my speech by offering my warmest congratulations to you on being elected the President of the 80th session of this organisation, formed with the noble aim of bringing about a just and lasting peace among the nations of the world.I would also like to use this opportunity to express my country’s appreciation to His Excellency Philemon Young for the exceptional leadership he provided during the 79th session. We are gathered here today to plan the future path of this organisation, which has worked tirelessly for eight decades to bring about a world of peace.It is my honour to address this August Assembly for the first time as the President of Sri Lanka.As representatives of nations, we all bear the responsibility to work towards fulfilling the aspirations of our people. The decisions we make now will impact people across the world and play a decisive role in the future of this planet, our common home. Distinguished delegates,Our decisions will have a very important impact on our future. Poverty, a tragedy as old as human civilisation, has accompanied humankind on its journey through time. For centuries, countries across the world have faced this painful and relentless struggle. Poverty and problems stemming from it are also casting an oppressive shadow on our future. This assembly must pay special attention to eradicate extreme poverty. I believe our conscience dictates us to do so. Distinguished delegates, For centuries, many countries in the world are struggling against poverty. Poverty is a terrible enemy with many faces. Even as we gather here in the countries we represent, including in my own, children are suffering from hunger. A child’s right to education is an internationally accepted fundamental right.This right is enshrined in the constitutions of most of our nations. Yet, across the world, poverty has denied this right to hundreds of thousands of children. In a world which boasts of its technological advances, how can there be children without access to education? Education is the foundation of every great nation.It is the most vital factor deciding one’s future. We firmly believe that investment in education is an investment in global progress. Many developing countries are constrained in their struggle against poverty by indebtedness.Low-income countries allocate twice as much on debt servicing than on education or healthcare.Our people and our countries are caught in debt traps. The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development pledges to leave no one behind and to reach the last first. The Agenda acknowledges the most critical challenge before the world is the challenge to end poverty.I would also like to recall the decisions taken at the Global Summit for Social Development in Copenhagen in 1995. However, wars and political upheavals and the COVID pandemic have obstructed the fulfilment of these hopeful agendas. I propose to you that the time has come to accept that inequality and poverty are a global catastrophe and we should act accordingly. Madam President, esteemed guests, Drugs and organised crimes linked to drugs have become a serious concern to this world. This has been acknowledged in the World Drug Report 2025 published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime.The drug problem is a complex issue affecting millions of people globally. The market for drugs and the related criminal organisations are creating issues globally. Drug cartels are turning entire states into their hunting grounds. They pose a major threat to global health and politics and eventually global well-being as well.While Sri Lanka is taking effective steps to address this challenge, I respectfully request all of you to join in the effort to implement the global agenda on drugs and crime.I bring to your notice the need to implement the law strictly against these drug traffickers and prevent drug traffickers from taking refuge in our countries and also to set up rehabilitation centres for rehabilitation purposes.Madam President, honoured guests, We regard corruption as an epidemic causing widespread harm to broad swathes of society. We believe corruption to be an obstruction for development, a decisive threat to democracy and global well-being and also a cause for poverty. Let me remind you that fighting corruption is dangerous, but not fighting corruption is even more dangerous.The Universal Declaration of Human Rights of 1948 was a remarkable victory for the people of the world. Civilisational achievements were never accomplished overnight. They were all results of unwavering efforts and sacrifices. And the struggle against corruption is also a difficult one. We must take the necessary steps here. The first step may be difficult, but if the courageous first step we take is correct, a thousand steps will follow. That is what I believe.Madam President, delegates, be brave. All the rest will follow.Sri Javaharlal Nehru has once stated so. I represent a small island of nearly 22 million people. Sri Lanka’s population is about 0.30 of the global population. It is true that we are small in size and in numbers, yet we have begun the struggle against corruption for the future generations of our country and the world. I propose that an integral part of the culture of all UN member countries should be to fight against corruption.Madam President, I feel confident that all of you will join me in condemning war. There is no nation in the world that desires a war. The result of a war is a tragedy wherever it happens. We all know that. Even now, many countries of the world are experiencing the pain of that tragedy. As a country that lived through a three-decade war, we know well the futility of war. No one who sees the pain and the suffering of parents, spouses and children of the victims of war would never dream of another war.We have witnessed these painful sights with our own eyes. Even as suffering caused by conflict has reached unprecedented levels, the international community has become reduced to bystanders.Opportunistic power politics has turned the lives of children and innocent civilians into a game. No one has the right to inflict pain and suffering on another to enhance one’s own power. The duty of a ruler is not to destroy lives but to protect them. We are deeply distressed by the ongoing catastrophe in the Gaza Strip. Gaza has been turned into an open prison full of pain and suffering, echoing with the cries of children and the innocent civilians. The United Nations Organisation and all related parties must work towards an immediate ceasefire, enable adequate humanitarian aid to these areas and to ensure the release of hostages of all parties. We recognise the Palestinian people’s inalienable right to their own state.We also believe that legal, security and humanitarian concerns of Israel and Palestinian people need to be acknowledged. Sri Lanka reiterates the importance of early implementation of the UN General Assembly resolutions regarding a two-state solution on the basis of the 1967 borders. The time has come for the international community to stop being a mere spectator and to move decisively to end the suffering of millions. Religious extremism and racism have been major causes of wars and conflicts, bringing suffering to millions of people.Although a century has passed since the abolition of slavery, the poison of racism still lingers in many places. Extremist and racist ideas are as deadly as epidemics. We must ask ourselves how these extremist and racist ideas survive like sparks under the ashes in a world that has witnessed so many advances on so many fronts.I believe that we must awaken our conscience to oppose racism and religious extremism in protection of human rights and freedoms. We must be brave enough to speak up for peace. We must not be afraid to speak up against war. We must be afraid to speak up for war. In a world where millions of children die of hunger, we spend millions on weapons. When tens of millions die of inadequate health facilities, hundreds of millions are spent on futile wars. When hundreds of thousands of children are denied the right to an education, millions are spent on invading another’s land.If every inch of this world can be turned into peaceful communities, what a wonderful world would it be. As a country that suffered the horrors of war for decades, where families still weep in remembrance of their loved ones, we have a duty to make that heartfelt proposal.I would like to remind you that at the last election, the people of Sri Lanka decided in favour of a centuries-old dream. A legislature has been established according to that decision, reflecting the ethnic and religious diversity of the country.A parliament has been established with women and other marginalised communities in representation. We believe that the duty of legislatures is to develop the country and the people, not to develop themselves. And we have established that idea. Madam President, distinguished guests, Our people have chosen light over darkness. They have given their approval to realise the vision of a thriving nation, a beautiful life. To fulfil this historic mandate, we have focused on establishing non-corrupt administration, poverty eradication, and digitalisation. And we have also placed great emphasis on education health as well. We are moving towards these goals step by step. Digital democracy is one of our aims.Ensuring that every person and every country can enjoy the opportunities of the digital age is a global challenge. If we succeed in our task, we will be able to open doors to technology, accelerate development, and to strengthen governance. If we fail, technology will turn into one more force, worsening inequality, insecurity, and injustice.The digital gap between states that can and cannot establish access to digital tools is clear. An even greater gap is being created in relation to artificial intelligence. Sri Lanka and many other developing nations in Asia and also many other nations are facing challenges in using AI as a development tool due to the inadequate infrastructure facilities.Madam President, distinguished delegates, I ask the international community to work together and we have to develop a dignified society, a dignified world. I present this August assembly a proposal to set up a neutral sovereign Artificial Intelligence zone. We must build a new and better world, a world which represents the dignity of humankind. You as members of this assembly must be the architects of that better world.As President Harry Truman stated on the occasion of founding the United Nations, in your hands rests our future. We must not act in fear or under compulsion, but with hope for a better and more secure world.Today we must commit ourselves not to lead the world to another disaster, but to make it a better place for the next generation. I have dreams and expectations for my country. Similarly, you have dreams and expectations for your countries. My dream is to ensure that my people are rich and they have happiness. I believe that you too have such dreams. We must try to achieve these dreams not in competition with each other, but by working arm in arm, peace, dignity, and equality on a healthy planet. That is the motto of the United Nations organisation. Therefore, let us become the true healers of the world.The post President AKD Calls for Global Unity in Address to UN, Urges Immediate Action on Gaza and Global Crises appeared first on LNW Lanka News Web.",

      "Hanoi (VNA) - In nearly one year, about 170,000 new businesses in Vietnam have adopted artificial intelligence (AI) in their operations and service delivery, according to Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) Unlocking Vietnam’s AI Potential study. To better understand the scope of AI and where companies of different scales might be headed, AWS collaborated with Strand Partners to conduct the study, which surveyed 1,000 business leaders, and 1,000 nationally representative members of the public. Nationwide, around 47,000 businesses, or 13% of Vietnamese businesses, adopted AI solutions in 2024, averaging five every hour. Almost 170,000, or 18%, now use AI, showing a year-on-year growth rate of 39%. The productivity and economic potential of AI adoption are promising. Vietnamese businesses show strong AI innovation adoption, demonstrating significant economic potential, said Eric Yeo, Country General Manager, AWS Vietnam. The survey shows that 61% of Vietnam’s businesses that have adopted AI reported an increase in revenue, at an average rise of 16%, while 58% expected an average of 20% in cost savings. The level of AI adoption also shows polarisation among businesses. As many as 55% of start-ups are using AI in some way, of which 35% are building entirely new AI-driven products. In contrast, 41% of large enterprises use AI, but only 11% of these are delivering a new AI-driven product or service, and only 12% have a comprehensive AI strategy. Clearly, start-ups in Vietnam show a much stronger interest and sharper responsiveness in applying and leveraging the strengths of AI, with a pace of adopting advanced technologies that far surpasses many long-established enterprises. “The nimbler, faster-paced start-ups are also pulling ahead of large enterprises in their speed and depth of innovation. The resulting ‘two-tier’ AI economy could have lasting implications on a country’s future economic development. Celebrating AI adoption numbers alone masks the deeper challenges many businesses face across Vietnam,” said Nick Bonstow, Director at Strand Partners. Although AI adoption in Vietnam is growing rapidly, most businesses remain at a basic level and have yet to fully tap into the potential of this technology. About 74% of businesses remain focused primarily on basic AI uses, like driving efficiencies and streamlining processes. Just 17% have advanced to the intermediate stage of AI adoption, and only 9% have reached the most transformative stage of AI integration, where AI is no longer just a tool but a core part of product development, decision-making, and business models. A lack of skilled personnel is the leading reason that 55% of surveyed firms said is preventing them from adopting or expanding their use of AI. Many reported having the technology and the vision, but are unable to find the people to bring it to life. Lastly, with 69% saying they are more likely to adopt AI if the government leads, it will be critical to accelerate digital transformation in the public sector, especially in healthcare and education, and use public procurement to drive innovation./.",

The disparity between start-ups and large enterprises in terms of AI adoption and innovation speed could lead to a 'two-tier' AI economy in Vietnam. This divide may have lasting implications for the country's future economic development.\nThe study underscores the need for a more inclusive approach to AI adoption across all business sizes in Vietnam. As the country continues to harness the power of AI, it is essential to address the challenges and ensure that the benefits of this technology are accessible to all sectors of the economy.",

In 2025, leading vendors converged on "lights-out-ready" workflows: from AI-assisted job setup to predictive maintenance and automated quality monitoring. HP Indigo used CHINA PRINT 2025 to show an AI-underpinned portfolio and debut the Indigo 120K HD and 18K HD in Asia, positioning the line as a bridge from analog to digital with higher uptime and operator-lite changeovers. For plants targeting quieter operations, smarter motion control and closed-loop QA also reduce mechanical stress and vibration-two drivers of acoustic output over long shifts. Throughput records raise the bar-without sacrificing stability. Kodak turned heads at Hunkeler Innovationdays 2025 with its PROSPER 7000 Turbo-a web-fed full-color inkjet press demonstrated at up to 410 m/min. Beyond raw speed, Kodak showcased stable output at frame rates high enough to play back moving sequences on the press monitors-evidence of tightly synchronized transport, drying, and inspection subsystems. In "silent" production environments, higher stability typically correlates with less rattle, better damping, and smoother drive profiles, which can meaningfully lower perceived noise despite higher web speeds. Component-level advances unlock broader materials-and quieter duty cycles. Epson\'s S3200-U1-2, S3200-U3-2, and D3000-U1R printheads improve UV-ink compatibility, reliability and continuous-use stability at up to 1,200 dpi with near-nozzle recirculation. For OEMs, easier drop-in upgrades allow tuning pumps and fans more conservatively for specific substrates-often reducing acoustic peaks. Expanded UV compatibility also shifts work from solvent-heavy lines to cleaner, digitally cured workflows favored in modern "quiet" factories. "Connected Automation" matures from slogan to factory reality. Komori\'s 2025 program emphasized Connected Automation and unveiled a 29-inch sheetfed UV inkjet press for China, while also showcasing a Virtual Smart Factory environment at its Tsukuba technology center. The direction of travel is unmistakable: press islands integrated into MES/ERP, autonomous makeready, and sensors feeding predictive models. These smart-factory principles are allies of "silent" operation-precise motion planning and edge analytics can trim unnecessary accelerations, tame fans during dwell periods, and surface early signs of noisy wear before failures. Packaging and labels remain the noise-sensitive growth engine. The report highlights packaging and label printing as dominant downstream drivers. In practice, these jobs increasingly run inside mixed-use facilities (often near converting, inspection, and fulfillment), where noise limits and operator well-being are mandated by policy or customer ESG requirements. That\'s pushing buyers toward digitally-native, servo-rich architectures with better isolation, passive/active damping, and refined airflow-hardware traits that sit under the "silent" umbrella even when not marketed explicitly as such. Profit pools shift toward uptime, service, and software. 2025 manufacturer results reinforce that margins depend on steady utilization and service monetization-not just hardware list price. Koenig & Bauer\'s 2024 results show a 23.1% gross margin amid revenue softness; management is steering toward 5-6% operating EBIT margin by 2026 by leaning into service, packaging, and efficiency levers. Heidelberg exited FY2024/25 with a steady 7.1% adjusted EBITDA margin and now guides toward up to ~8% in FY2025/26, citing cost discipline and order intake post-drupa. For buyers, that translates to stronger software roadmaps and more embedded automation features in 2025 refreshes-many of which tend to be quieter by design. Low-noise by design: a competitive differentiator-especially in retrofits. Although vendors seldom brand large production presses as "silent," engineering attention to acoustics is rising. At the component level, quieter linear drives and stepper/servo drivers, tuned motion profiles, better frame damping, and more efficient curing/cooling are filtering from high-end SKUs into mid-range models. With Epson\'s 2025 printhead family broadening the UV window, OEMs can redesign duty cycles (less purge, smoother re-circulation) to keep fan peaks down and avoid resonance at common line speeds. In short, the "silent" in smart silent printing is increasingly achieved via system-level orchestration rather than a single noise-reduction feature. Regional momentum: Asia\'s showcase year. CHINA PRINT 2025 emerged as the year\'s most influential venue for smart, automated presses. HP Indigo\'s 120K HD and 18K HD Asian debuts crystallized the market\'s pivot toward high-speed digital with lower operator load. Komori likewise used the Beijing stage to position new packaging and digital solutions. For procurement teams in APAC, the message is clear: fully integrated automation stacks are now widely available and shipping regionally, not just as Europe- or U.S.-centric flagships. What\'s new in 2025-headline achievements: •Kodak PROSPER 7000 Turbo: live 410 m/min inkjet demonstrations in Europe-pushing the speed frontier while highlighting stability, process control, and on-press quality visualization. •HP Indigo 120K HD & 18K HD: Asian debuts with AI-driven automation for faster changeovers and broader application coverage-converters can consolidate more work onto fewer, smarter lines. •Epson S3200/U-series & D3000-U1R: new printheads with enhanced UV compatibility, higher reliability, and 1,200 dpi capability-accelerating OEM upgrades and enabling quieter, more efficient duty cycles. •Komori "Connected Automation" & Smart Factory: from exhibit themes to a fully operational Virtual Smart Factory at Tsukuba, signaling that Industry 4.0 for print is now concrete. Downstream companies: •All Color Printers •E.B. Box Company •Edelmann Group •Grupo Gráfico Romo •J.S. McCarthy Packaging + Print •Moquin Press •Peczuh Printing & Paperbox •Spectrum Packaging Corporation •Caribbean Label Crafts •I.B.E. •SPC (Spectrum Packaging Corporation again) •McLean Packaging Request for Pre-Order Enquiry On This Report Strategy implications for 2025-2027 buys. Given the market\'s 14.7% CAGR trajectory to 2031, buyers should: 1.prioritize architectures with native AI/automation hooks (pathway to quieter, more stable production); 2.require printhead-upgrade roadmaps (like Epson\'s) to extend machine life and reduce retrofit noise/energy penalties; 3.model gross profit not just from throughput but from noise-compliant shift patterns (night operations, urban plants) that smart/silent machines uniquely unlock; and 4.benchmark service and software SLAs-as suppliers chase higher operating margins, buyers can negotiate bundled analytics/QA features that improve both uptime and acoustic performance.

      "PeopleImages // ShutterstockHow to vibe code: 11 vibe coding best practices to start building with AIThings are frankly ridiculous right now with AI building—in the best possible way. Vibe coding tools like Lovable, Bolt, and Cursor are democratizing software development. And that means that you can more or less just jump in and start creating, experimenting all you want, with no constrictions.But if you want to build something sturdy, you’ll need to go in with a plan, rather than expecting a complex finished project in a few prompts.To help you vibe, Zapier put together tips for starting a vibe coding project that has the potential to result in a usable final product, based on insights from industry folks.Don’t expect magicWith all the excitement over one-shot prompts to finished projects, starting with a simplicity mindset is pretty hard to do. So many shiny things, so little patience.But trying to build an entire project with one prompt is a losing battle. No matter how detailed your request is, the AI won’t fully respect every aspect of it.“Solve small problems. Don’t try to go build it all with one prompt,” Michael Lembo, staff product manager at BitGo, recommends.Keep reading to get a hefty handful of tips about all the things you need to do before you even start building.Write a product requirements document (PRD)Before you even start building, create a product requirements document (PRD). It’ll be the building plan for your app, in clear and detailed language.You’re building the PRD to help your favorite vibe coding tool follow your vision in a structured way, yes. But it’ll also help you get clear on what you want and how you’re going to get there. It’s an opportunity to think through the finer details of how your final product should function and what technologies you’ll need to incorporate to make that happen.Try building out your PRD in an AI chatbot like ChatGPT or an AI code editor like Cursor. Provide an initial prompt for what you want it to do and ask it to generate its first take on the ideal project PRD. Then edit the PRD based on any incorrect assumptions you want to set straight before the build. ZapierYour PRD should include the following, at a minimum:A clear description of what your app does, who it’s for, and how it functions.Technologies underlying each function (and their purpose).Project milestone stages and details—this is important; you’ll use these like a compass during the build phase. ZapierThis kind of detailed planning will also help you save your credits when you move into your AI coding app. As Matt Medeiros, publisher at The WP Minute, suggests, “Take your time. Spend resources planning your app before you jump into vibe coding in Bolt or Lovable. Use vanilla ChatGPT or another LLM to prove and test your ideas before writing code.”Co-Maker of ttyl, Robinson Greig, says, “Good instructions yield good results. Take the time to write detailed requirements.”Wireframe your user interface (UI) firstAlfred Megally, vibe coder and independent creative, says: “Think about how a user would flow through your project from beginning to end.” That will help you—and your AI creative partner—think through the logic of what you want to build, influencing the later steps in the process.Think of it as a pressure test for your PRD. Test your assumptions, and then make updates to the PRD after going through this process and discovering where logic breaks down.Try working with Claude to build a wireframe of a UI in the early stages of a project. Then, once you’re ready to build a more functional UI that incorporates more distinct branding elements, move to an AI coding app like Lovable. Or you could even try a purpose-built wireframing app. ZapierThink of your wireframe as a rough draft—the UI will undoubtedly change when you’re in the thick of the build process, but this will help you get into the shoes of your users.Set up GitHub for version controlGitHub is a web app for sharing code. Use it to create a repository for each project, and push code changes along the way for simple version control and collaboration.GitHub has native (or otherwise seamless) integrations with most vibe coding tools, so it works even if you move across platforms during your build. For example, if you started building in a Lovable, you could push your Lovable code to GitHub and then pull it into a project in Cursor. This approach takes advantage of each tool’s unique strengths: Lovable’s UI building and Cursor’s back-end building.If you’re already mid-project, you can set up a GitHub repository at any point in the build, but it’s a best practice to have it in place from the start. And when things are working, push those changes to GitHub (often).If you’re new to GitHub, check out Morten Rand-Hendriksen’s Git from Scratch course on LinkedIn Learning to dive in a bit deeper.Create global rulesEach vibe coding platform has its own way of handling overarching account and project preferences. No matter which tool you’re using, make sure you set up these global rules.If you’ve ever created a custom GPT, you’ve done this before. The following example uses Cursor because it has the most robust solution as of this writing.Global rules in Cursor are managed by the optional creation of a .cursorrules file for each project. It’s something you build out over time based on the types of projects you’re working on and how you want to customize the agent to collaborate with you.You don’t have to start completely from scratch. Check out Cursor Directory for a repository of rules built and shared by Cursor users. Look for templates based on the types of programming languages you’ve determined you’ll be building with.To give you an idea of what global rules actually look like, here’s a sample boilerplate .cursorrules rule set for a JavaScript project. ZapierFor Cursor, rules are especially useful because they tap into the persona pattern for AI prompting. By stating something like “You are a senior front-end developer...” you’re narrowing the scope of how you want the agent to respond. This is much more useful when building than giving the agent free rein.Start with a template, and build out your own global rules over time.Create a database before you buildIf you need a way to store data or a way for users to manipulate data, you need a database. Even if you just want to add sign-in functionality (creating separate user profiles with their associated data), you need a database. If this isn’t relevant to your current vibe coding project, you can skip ahead. ZapierDatabases are complex beasts, so to start with a caveat: This is a majorly simplified explanation—but you’ve got to start somewhere.Database design is similar to organizing data on a spreadsheet, with details stored in labeled columns. For example, an app might have a user table with associated data like the user’s name, email, and birthday. It may have other tables with other data types that can also be associated with users, like a table of board game options that users can favorite and associate with their user data. If you’ve ever used Airtable, it works kind of like that.When vibe coding more complex apps that require databases (like the tasting notes app, Taste), trying to add new database functionality later in the build process can be like pulling teeth. Thinking through it ahead of time will save a lot of tokens and grief.Many popular vibe coding apps have native (or similarly seamless) integrations with Supabase, which is one of the more popular database options for vibe coders. Firebase is another solid option with comparable (and generous) free tiers. ZapierSet up secrets (API keys and access details)If you’re planning on connecting any third-party tools to your app, you’ll need to set up your “secrets”: the specific API keys and related access details for each integration.Tracking down APIs can be a time sucking task, so it’s nice to batch this all at once. In most vibe coding tools, you’ll be prompted to share the APIs securely in the tool’s Secrets section. ZapierWhen using an integrated development environment (IDE) like Cursor, you’ll instead create a .env file to store these secrets. ZapierImportant: When using a .env file with an IDE, set up .gitignore to ignore your sensitive keys (among other things) when committing public code changes to GitHub.Break down the build, step by stepEight tips later, and you’re finally ready to start building.First, let’s go over the don’ts:Don’t try to build multiple features at once. Start simple. Build everything step by step, and be specific in describing what you want to happen—along with why, where, and how you want it to happen.Don’t fix multiple unrelated issues in one prompt. This is tempting, especially to “maximize” tokens, but you’ll probably introduce more problems than you fix.Don’t jump ahead to future steps before completing the current one. For example, let’s say you plan to eventually integrate Stripe for payments, so you install it before you build a component for it in your code. Some part of your code may then expect a reference to Stripe that it can’t find, and it might throw an error that adds confusion.Ok, now let’s move on to how to make it work.The very first step of a build usually involves installing libraries and dependencies. This typically means installing the JavaScript library first, followed by a dependency like ESLint to handle code formatting errors.If that sounds confusing, don’t sweat the details. The more beginner-friendly vibe coding tools (like Lovable) handle much of this without your input, but you have a chance to interact with the process when using more advanced tools like Cursor. ZapierThe next steps involve integrating functionality one step at a time.Expect the build process to take multiple steps, and be very focused and specific in how you approach each one. Treat each step like it’s your most important prompt.It helps to think in terms of logical build phases—what has to happen first before you can add a related feature? For example, it usually makes sense to build some of the back-end functionality before finalizing the design. The back-end technologies and how the user interacts with them might change a few times before it makes sense to spend more time on the details of the interface. You don’t want to have to update the interface every time you change the back end if you don’t need to. And since you’ve already worked out a wireframe, you have a general sense of how it’ll look anyway.Matt Medeiros says it’s best to “prompt your coding app to keep your app modular and only request small features at a time.” That “keep your app modular” advice is important. The bigger the files are, the more potential there is for context issues. Making changes to individual components that have a narrower context is more straightforward. AI apps can help you split up large files into smaller ones, so you don’t have to do it on your own.Review before accepting changes—and test oftenYou don’t have to be a programmer to identify the most blatant hallucinations and nip them in the bud. Take an interest in the process and the details, and vibe debugging will be a lot easier.And remember, you have an AI assistant who’s fluent in programming to help. Justin Lai, educational technologist at La Pietra Hawai’i School for Girls, offers this reminder: “When in doubt, ask it to explain a coding concept.” ZapierThe same goes for troubleshooting. Does the agent have enough context to troubleshoot an error effectively, or will its current context create a hallucination that breaks more than it fixes?The robots lie, but it’s not on purpose—they just want to make you happy. Don’t take everything the agent says at face value. No matter how confident they are that “that should fix the issue,” it’s up to you to verify. So before you accept the changes, really read through them and see if you notice any obvious red flags.Another thing: Expect that by adding a new feature, you’ll create issues in at least two other features. The AI won’t automatically fix previous steps to match the new steps. Be sure to run a lot of tests to check that your expectations match what’s actually happening. Your AI coding tool will execute the code whenever you want, so you can see what’s working (and more importantly, what’s not).Don’t get too invested in one projectVibe coding is addictive. And just like most addictions, it can get very expensive very quickly.So be aware of how it can suck you in. Consider setting boundaries, like dedicated time blocks that you don’t exceed.Similarly, you need to be able to admit when something’s just not working. It’s easy to get into a black hole with a doomed project or feature. As Andy Keil, cofounder (with Kyle Ledbetter) at Dreambase, says, “Don’t be afraid to throw work away if you hit a wall and it feels like it’s spiraling.”Instead, take what you’ve learned and start fresh with your new knowledge and understanding of where you want to go. Walking away is hard, but with vibe coding, it’s easy to start a new project.Just start building“It’s super inspiring to take an idea, craft a prompt, and watch it come to life through AI,” says Joe Frabotta, Growth Marketer. “It opens up a whole new world of creativity.” And sometimes, that creativity is all you need. If you’re feeling stuck, just dive in.“I’ve always had tons of thoughts about what I could build, but didn’t have the skills, resources, or tools to even get to the prototyping stage. Now, that’s all changed,” Frabotta says.This story was produced by Zapier and reviewed and distributed by Stacker.

      "In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-driven software development, Zapier has compiled 11 best practices to guide developers through the process of creating robust applications using vibe coding tools such as Lovable, Bolt, and Cursor. These tools are revolutionizing the industry by making software development more accessible and less constrained.\nThe first tip from Zapier is to maintain a simplicity mindset. Michael Lembo, a staff product manager at BitGo, advises against trying to build an entire project with a single prompt. Instead, he suggests solving small problems step by step. This approach acknowledges the limitations of AI in fully understanding and executing complex requests.\nA critical step in the development process is writing a product requirements document (PRD). This document serves as a blueprint for the application, detailing the desired features and functionalities in clear and structured language. It helps developers articulate their vision and plan the necessary technologies to bring it to life.\nZapier recommends using AI tools like ChatGPT or Cursor to draft the initial PRD. Developers can provide a prompt describing their desired project and then refine the PRD based on the AI's output. This iterative process allows for corrections and clarifications, ensuring that the final document accurately reflects the project's goals.\nBy following these best practices, developers can leverage AI to its full potential, creating applications that are not only innovative but also reliable and user-friendly.
